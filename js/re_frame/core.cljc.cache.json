Optionally, provide\n  an `interceptors` chain.\n  `id` is typically a namespaced keyword  (but can be anything)\n  `handler` is a function: (coeffects-map event-vector) -> effects-map\n  `interceptors` is a collection of interceptors. Will be flattened and nils removed.\n  `handler` is wrapped in its own interceptor and added to the end of the interceptor\n   chain, so that, in the end, only a chain is registered.\n   Special effects and coeffects interceptors are added to the front of the\n   interceptor chain.  These interceptors inject the value of app-db into coeffects,\n   and, later, action effects."],"~$register-handler",["^ ","^1:",null,"^14",["^ ","^[","/Users/jacek/Projects/conduit/resources/public/js/re_frame/core.cljc","^10",225,"^11",7,"^12",225,"^13",23,"^1;",["^1<",["^1=",["^1<",[["~$&","^1M"]]]]],"^1N",["^ ","^1B",true,"^1F",0,"^1C",[["^1<",["^1M"]]],"^1;",["^1<",[["~$&","^1M"]]],"^1E",["^1<",[null]]]],"^7","~$re-frame.core/register-handler","^1B",true,"^[","resources/public/js/re_frame/core.cljc","^13",23,"^1N",["^ ","^1B",true,"^1F",0,"^1C",[["^1<",["^1M"]]],"^1;",["^1<",[["~$&","^1M"]]],"^1E",["^1<",[null]]],"^1C",[["^1<",["^1M"]]],"^1D",null,"^1E",["^1<",[null]],"^11",1,"^10",225,"^12",225,"^1F",0,"^1G",true,"^1;",["^1<",[["~$&","^1M"]]]],"~$clear-subscription-cache!",["^ ","^7","~$re-frame.core/clear-subscription-cache!","^[","resources/public/js/re_frame/core.cljc","^10",49,"^11",1,"^12",49,"^13",31,"^14",["^ ","^[","/Users/jacek/Projects/conduit/resources/public/js/re_frame/core.cljc","^10",49,"^11",6,"^12",49,"^13",31]]],"~:cljs.spec/registry-ref",[],"~:require-macros",null,"~:cljs.analyzer/constants",["^ ","~:seen",["^6",["~:warn"]],"~:order",["^39"]],"^1@",null]
